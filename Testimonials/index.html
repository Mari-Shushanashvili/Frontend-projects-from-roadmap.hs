            Since starting my career in 2021, I have inly followed one resource,
            roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go from 0 to having a job and
            changing the financial trajectory of my life.

            I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior
            developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

                roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to dicover it
                during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
                repository with 3 images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has
                had on millions of lives since then.
