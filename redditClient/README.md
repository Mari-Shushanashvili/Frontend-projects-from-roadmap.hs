I created a browser-based Reddit client that displays multiple subreddits in separate, customizable lanes.
I worked with the Reddit JSON feed to fetch posts from different subreddits and display them in a dynamic, responsive layout.
The application will allow users to add new subreddit lanes by entering a subreddit name.
It will verify the existence of the subreddit, fetch its posts, and display them in a new lane. 
Each lane will show the subredditâ€™s posts, including titles, authors, and vote counts.
The application should handle loading states while fetching data, display error messages for invalid subreddits or API issues, 
and provide a smooth user experience when adding or removing lanes.
