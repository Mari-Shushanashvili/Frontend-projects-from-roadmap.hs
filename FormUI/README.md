### Accessible Form UI
In this project, I created a form UI using only HTML and CSS.
The form includes fields for a full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text.
Additionally, the form features a completeness progress bar and a checklist of requirements that must be met for the form to reach 100% completeness.
While this version of the form isn't functional, it is a static UI component that can be enhanced with JavaScript in the future.
